        <h1>Pepperoni Pizza</h1>
        <p1>This Homemade Pepperoni Pizza has everything you wantâ€”a great crust, gooey cheese, and tons of pepperoni. The secret to great pepperoni flavor? Hide extra under the cheese! Who needs delivery?</p1>
        <p2>First, on the dough: Don't get overwhelmed! If it's your first time making pizza at home, just buy the dough. You can usually find pizza dough at the grocery store, or some pizza places will sell you a one-pound ball of dough for a few bucks.</p2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons (slightly less than a full packet) instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (350g) lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the Dough:</strong>
                <p1>In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, combine the flour, yeast, and salt on low speed. Add the water all at once and mix until the dough comes together and cleans the sides of the bowl, about 30 to 60 seconds. You don't need to knead it, just get all the ingredients mixed together. The dough will be soft and slightly sticky, with no more visible streaks of flour on the surface. 
                    To mix by hand, follow the same procedure using a large bowl and a wooden spoon.</p1></li>
            <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise:</strong>
                <p1>Drizzle a large, clean mixing bowl with oil. Flour your hands and form the dough into a rough ball. Transfer it to the oiled bowl and twirl it around a few times to coat it with oil.

                Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave to rise for 2 to 3 hours at room temperature, until doubled in bulk.
                
                After rising, you can refrigerate the dough for up to 48 hours. Take the dough out of the refrigerator about 1 hour before shaping.</p1></li>
            <li><strong>Shape and Use the Dough</strong>
            <p1>Once risen, the dough is ready to be shaped into pizzas and baked. Use this dough for any pizza recipe you want to make and follow recipe instructions for shaping and baking times.</p1></li>
